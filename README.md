## Repository Overview

This repository contains a folder for each of two analyses:
* PyBank - Analysis of my company's financial information
* PyPoll - Analysis of election results for a small rural town

Each folder includes a main Python code file, a text file containing summary analysis results, and the source CSV file containing the raw data used in the analysis.

### PyBank

The main Python code file, main.py, is located in the main folder.

* Analysis: Contains the summary results file summary.txt
* Resources: Contains the raw data file budget_data.csv

This analysis gave the total months included in the company's financial records, the total profit earned during the time period included in the records, and the average monthly change in profit/loss. The analysis also identified the months with the greatest profit and loss, respectively.

### PyPoll

The main Python code file, main.py, is located in the main folder.

* Analysis: Contains the summary results file summary.txt
* Resources: Contains the raw data file election_data.csv

This analysis gave the total votes cast in the election for all candidates as well as the number and percentage of votes earned by each of the four candidates. The analysis also recorded an election winner.
